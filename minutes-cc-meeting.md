## Action items from last meeting
None, this is the first community meeting

## What has the community been working on
* Lisa is gearing up to attend two conferences and has been manning the twitter account
* Roo has been working on the faucet and how the networking piece fits together
* Rob has been working on smart contracts
* Kade has submitted Aletheia to the Free Software Foundation database, made a submission to Linuxconf AU, was interviewed for Colper Science podcast, dug up some opensouce Ethereum identity smart contracts the project might be able to use, and gearing up to speak at MozFest.

## Items discussed
* Swarm and IPFS both have their pros and cons, there will be a discussion closer to Swarm's release (which there is no hard date on as yet) about shifting to Swarm or staying with IPFS.
* There are pros and cons around being on an Ethereum test net and the main net. Rob suggested side chains as a way of joining the main net at a lower cost.
* Rob ran through smart contracts he has been working on around incentivising peer review. At this point the smart contracts will mos likely be accepted as they have been proposed as we have had a number of people tell us incentivising peer review is something that seriously needs to be considered.
* Kade gave an update on the establishment of the foundation, we are still waiting on the lawyers
* The milestone of an MVP by November won't be met and will be reassessed. 
* It's generally agreed Aletheia needs to support ORCID.
* We still need a website. Roo has web development skills but is overworked, agreed do not want to pay for external party to build a website so we need to source a volunteer.
* Skype is our agreed platform of choice for community calls until we change our minds.
* Kade ran through reputation and how he sees it working down the track for Aletheia.

## Items discussed
What exchange are we going to use? We think we will go with Kraken
For bank account looks like we will go with Westpac
ORCID might not be as simple as was decided and we may need to incorporate it into the application or see if they can incorporate an Aletheia ID of some description. 
The submission contract needs further defining so we can create a single design document people can reference.
