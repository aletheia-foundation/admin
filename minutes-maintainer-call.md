## Action items from last meeting
Call was specifically to discuss side chains and cost minimisation for running Aletheia so didn't go over previous call action items

## Items discussed

* We tried to pin down our next steps for quantifying what joining the main Ethereum Chain was going to cost us. We hammered out these steps which seem embarissingly straightforward in hindsight:

1. Figure out all the things that need to go in the smart contract required for submitting papers
2. Write the contract
3. Run it through a debugger to give us gas cost per submission
4. Model of an estimated user base

* We then discussed what needs to go into the smart contract, which we decided as metadata and citations
* To avoid people impersonating others by entering someone else's ORCID on Aletheia/on the submitted paper, we want to see if we can have people associate their ORCID with their Aletheia account off Aletheia.
* Current estimate is we will have some form of a contract for next community call 09/09/2017

* [ ] Rob to write the submission smart contract
